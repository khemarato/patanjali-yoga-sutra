## Chapter 1: Samādhi






1.1: _atha yogā nuśāsanam_  
Yoga is now explained.

1.2: _yogaś citta-vṛtti nirodhaḥ_  
Yoga is for the mind's whirling to cease.

1.3: _tadā draṣṭuḥ svarūpe 'vasthānam_  
At that time, the seer rests in appearances.

1.4: _vṛtti-sārūpyam itaratra_  
Otherwise, [the *citta*] conforms to the whirling.

1.5: _vṛttayaḥ pañcatayyaḥ kliṣṭākliṣṭāḥ_  
There are five whirlings, defiled and not:

1.6: _pramāṇa viparyaya vikalpa nidrā smṛtayaḥ_  
grasping, aversion, conceptualization, drowsiness, and recollection.

1.7: _pratyakṣānumānāgamāḥ pramāṇāni_  
Grasping [can be based on] attention, inference, or hearsay.

1.8: _viparyayo mithyājñānam atadrūpapratiṣṭham_  
Aversion is a false knowing, not materially established.

1.9: _śabdajñānānupātī vastuśūnyo vikalpaḥ_  
Conceptualization isn't objective, following on from [mere] verbal knowledge.

1.10: _abhāvapratyayālambanā vṛttir nidrā_  
Drowsiness is a whirling which embraces fading away.

1.11: _anubhūtaviṣayāsaṃpramoṣaḥ smṛtiḥ_  
Recollection is not being deprived of experiences.

1.12: _abhyāsavairāgyābhyāṃ tannirodhaḥ_  
Stopping this [whirling] is [achieved] by practice and renunciation.

1.13: _tatra sthitau yatno 'bhyāsaḥ_  
Practice means striving for stability.

1.14: _sa tu dīrghakālanairantaryasatkārāsevito dṛḍhabhūmiḥ_  
This is only firmly grounded when cultivated properly and for a long time uninterrupted.

1.15: _dṛṣṭānuśravikaviṣayavitṛṣṇasya vaśīkārasaṃjñā vairāgyam_  
Renunciation is knowing how to be without thirst for things seen or heard about.

1.16: _tat paraṃ puruṣakhyāter guṇavaitṛṣṇyam_  
The higher [renunciation] is the non-thirst towards sense contact via self-possession.

1.17: _vitarka vicār' ānand' āsmitā rūpā-nugamāt saṃprajñātaḥ_  
Effort, thought, joy, [and] conceit [make for] form-connected understanding.

1.18: _virāmapratyayābhyāsapūrvaḥ saṃskāraśeṣo 'nyaḥ_  
Another [level of *samādhi*] has [merely] a residual of mental activity [left] after the attentive practice stops.

1.19: _bhavapratyayo videhaprakṛtilayānām_  
Attention [then] becomes absorbed in a bodiless potential.

1.20: _śraddhāvīryasmṛtisamādhiprajñāpūrvaka itareṣām_  
The final is preceded by faith, energy, recollection, concentration, and discernment. 

1.21: _tīvrasaṃvegānām āsannaḥ_  
Extreme world-weariness is close [to the goal].

1.22: _mṛdumadhyādhimātratvāt tato 'pi viśeṣaḥ_  
Mild, moderate, or excessive also differentiates.

1.23: _īśvarapraṇidhānād vā_  
Or [*samādhi* can be gained] through devotion to *Īśvara*.

1.24: _kleśakarmavipākāśayair aparāmṛṣṭaḥ puruṣaviśeṣa īśvaraḥ_  
*Īśvara* is a different kind of person: untouched by defilements, *karma*, fruition, or tendency.

1.25: _tatra niratiśayaṃ sarvajñabījam_  
Here is the unsurpassed seed of all there is to know.

1.26: _pūrveṣām api guruḥ kālenānavacchedāt_  
The former [moment], also a teacher. Hence, temporal continuity.

1.27: _tasya vācakaḥ praṇavaḥ_  
His name is a [mere] vocalization.

1.28: _tajjapas tadarthabhāvanam_  
Say it, and you'll see what I mean.

1.29: _tataḥ pratyakcetanādhigamo 'py antarāyābhāvaś ca_  
From that: mindfulness and the disappearance of the obstacles.

1.30: _vyādhi styāna saṃśaya pramādālasyāvirati bhrānti darśanālabdha bhūmikatvānavasthitatvāni citta-vikṣepās te 'ntarāyāḥ_  
Disease, torpor, doubt, carelessness, sloth, compulsion, confusion, seeing the unobtained, instability in the foundation, [and] an anxious *citta*: these are the obstacles.

1.31: _duḥkha daurmanasyāṅgame jayatvaśvāsapraśvāsā vikṣepasahabhuvaḥ_  
The symptoms of anxiety are stress, depression, tremors in the limbs, and difficulty breathing.

1.32: _tat-pratiṣedhārtham eka-tattvābhyāsaḥ_  
The treatment is single-object practice.

1.33: _maitrī-karuṇā-mudit'-opekṣāṇāṃ sukha-duḥkha puṇy'-āpuṇya viṣayāṇāṃ bhāvanātaś citta-prasādanam_  
Loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity towards everything—pleasant, unpleasant, good and bad alike—pacifies the *citta*.

1.34: _pracchardanavidhāraṇābhyāṃ vā prāṇasya_  
Or the exhaling and inhaling of the breath

1.35: _viṣayavatī vā pravṛttir utpannā manasaḥ sthitinibandhanī_  
Or something which arises out of experience and arrests the mind.

1.36: _viśokā vā jyotiṣmatī_  
Or which is painless and enlightening

1.37: _vītarāgaviṣayaṃ vā cittam_  
Or something for which the *citta* is without passion

1.38: _svapnanidrājñānālambanaṃ vā_  
Or [you can] hang on to dream knowledge

1.39: _yathābhimatadhyānād vā_  
Or meditate on whatever suits you.

1.40: _paramāṇuparamamahattvānto 'sya vaśīkāraḥ_  
Mastery is from the most minute to the most grand.

1.41: _kṣīṇavṛtter abhijātasyeva maṇer grahītṛgrahaṇagrāhyeṣu tatsthatadañjanatā samāpattiḥ_  
The whirling abated—precious as a jewel!—the grasper, the grasping, and the grasped thus abiding and thus anointed: [this is] unification.

1.42: _tatra śabdārthajñānavikalpaiḥ saṃkīrṇā savitarkā samāpattiḥ_  
In that [state of] unification with effort, [there is still] sound, meaning, knowledge, and conceptualization.

1.43: _smṛtipariśuddhau svarūpaśūnyevārthamātranirbhāsā nirvitarkā_  
With the purification of mindfulness, [the mind] appears to be empty except for the object shining forth effortlessly.

1.44: _etayaiva savicārā nirvicārā ca sūkṣmaviṣayā vyākhyātā_  
This also explains the subtle things [about *samādhi*] with and without thought.

1.45: _sūkṣmaviṣayatvaṃ cāliṅgaparyavasānam_  
Even subtle “thingness” itself terminates in the featureless [absorptions].

1.46: _tā eva sabījaḥ samādhiḥ_  
[But] even these [states] are “*samādhi* with [karmic] seeds.”

1.47: _nirvicāravaiśāradye 'dhyātmaprasādaḥ_  
Thoughtless clarity is the heart of religiousity.

1.48: _ṛtaṃbharā tatra prajñā_  
Truth born this way is discerning.

1.49: _śrutānumānaprajñābhyām anyaviṣayā viśeṣārthatvāt_  
[Truths] which have been heard, inferred, or discerned are different things, [and have] different functions.

1.50: _tajjaḥ saṃskāro 'nyasaṃskārapratibandhī_  
The [mental] activity born from that [absorption], [temporarily] obstructs other activity.

1.51: _tasyāpi nirodhe sarvanirodhān nirbījaḥ samādhiḥ_  
With the cessation of even that, all ceases. This is the seedless *samādhi*.



## Chapter 2: Practice






2.1: _tapaḥsvādhyāyeśvarapraṇidhānāni kriyāyogaḥ_  
Austerity, recitation, [and] devotion to the present moment are active Yoga.

2.2: _samādhibhāvanārthaḥ kleśatanūkaraṇārthaś ca_  
[These practices] cultivate *samādhi* and weaken the defilements.

2.3: _avidyāsmitārāgadveṣābhiniveśāḥ kleśāḥ_  
The defilements are: ignorance, conceit, greed, aversion, and inertia.

2.4: _avidyā kṣetram uttareṣāṃ prasuptatanuvicchinnodārāṇām_  
Ignorance is the field for the rest, whether they be dormant, suppressed, weakened, or aroused.

2.5: _anityāśuciduḥkhānātmasu nityaśucisukhātmakhyātir avidyā_  
Ignorance is seeing as permanent, essential, satisfying, or self that which is really impermanent, inessential, unsatisfying, and not-self

2.6: _dṛgdarśanaśaktyor ekātmatevāsmitā_  
Conceit misidentifies the power of seeing as “a seer.”

2.7: _sukhānuśayī rāgaḥ_  
Greed is chasing [after] pleasure.

2.8: _duḥkhānuśayī dveṣaḥ_  
Aversion is chasing [away] pain.

2.9: _svarasavāhī viduṣo 'pi tathā rūḍho 'bhiniveśaḥ_  
Inertia is rooted in relishing one’s own stream of consciousness.

2.10: _te pratiprasavaheyāḥ sūkṣmāḥ_  
These are subtleties to be eliminated by going against the stream

2.11: _dhyānaheyās tadvṛttayaḥ_  
Eliminated, that is, through meditation.

2.12: _kleśamūlaḥ karmāśayo dṛṣṭādṛṣṭajanmavedanīyaḥ_  
The tendency to act is rooted in the defilements and is felt throughout seen and unseen births.

2.13: _sati mūle tadvipāko jātyāyurbhogāḥ_  
There being a root, there will be fruit: birth, aging, and experience.

2.14: _te hlādaparitāpaphalāḥ puṇyāpuṇyahetutvāt_  
These delightful and distressing fruits have merit and demerit as their cause.

2.15: _pariṇāmatāpasaṃskāraduḥkhair guṇavṛttivirodhāc ca duḥkham eva sarvaṃ vivekinaḥ_  
Change, austerity, activity, pain, sense contact, whirling, and conflict—to the discerning, however, all is stressful.

2.16: _heyaṃ duḥkham anāgatam_  
Eliminate future stress!

2.17: _draṣṭṛdṛśyayoḥ saṃyogo heyahetuḥ_  
Eliminate its cause: conflating “seeing” with “a seer”!

2.18: _prakāśakriyāsthitiśīlaṃ bhūtendriyātmakaṃ bhogāpavargārthaṃ dṛśyam_  
“Seeing” is [merely] the continuous, “brightness” activity with the virtue of transforming the elements and the [visual] faculties into objects of experience.

2.19: _viśeṣāviśeṣaliṅgamātrāliṅgāni guṇaparvāṇi_  
Differentiated, undifferentiated, distinct or indistinct are just levels of sense contact.

2.20: _draṣṭā dṛśimātraḥ śuddho 'pi pratyayānupaśyaḥ_  
“The seer” is only [the action of] seeing: pure attending and observing.

2.21: _tadartha eva dṛśyasyātmā_  
“Seeing” is, essentially, just for that purpose.

2.22: _kṛtārthaṃ prati naṣṭam apy anaṣṭaṃ tadanyasādhāraṇatvāt_  
Its purpose done, it vanishes—though the object doesn't, commonly speaking.

2.23: _svasvāmiśaktyoḥ svarūpopalabdhihetuḥ saṃyogaḥ_  
The power of ownership over things is a misunderstanding caused by this conflation.

2.24: _tasya hetur avidyā_  
The cause of this is ignorance.

2.25: _tadabhāvāt saṃyogābhāvo hānaṃ taddṛśeḥ kaivalyam_  
Eradicating it, the conflation is [also] eradicated. That letting go is seeing liberation.

2.26: _vivekakhyātir aviplavā hānopāyaḥ_  
Unremitting, detached awareness is the means for attaining detachment.

2.27: _tasya saptadhā prāntabhūmiḥ prajñā_  
It has seven parts and its final stage is wisdom.

2.28: _yogāṅgānuṣṭhānād aśuddhikṣaye jñānadīptir ā vivekakhyāteḥ_  
The “limbs” of Yoga, the wearing away of impurities, and the brilliance of *jhana* lead to detached awareness.

2.29: _yamaniyamāsanaprāṇāyāmapratyāhāradhāraṇādhyānasamādhayo 'ṣṭāv aṅgāni_  
The eight “limbs” are: restraint, observance, posture, watching the breath, guarding the senses, meditation and *samādhi*.

2.30: _ahiṃsāsatyāsteyabrahmacaryāparigrahā yamāḥ_  
Harmlessness, honesty, non-stealing, chastity and non-addiction are restraint.

2.31: _jātideśakālasamayānavacchinnāḥ sārvabhaumā mahāvratam_  
[Holding to these five precepts] in all spheres, [regardless of] birth, place, time, and mitigating circumstances constitutes the Great Vow.

2.32: _śaucasaṃtoṣatapaḥsvādhyāyeśvarapraṇidhānāni niyamāḥ_  
Purity, contentment, austerity, recitation, and devotion to the present are the observances.

2.33: _vitarkabādhane pratipakṣabhāvanam_  
Afflicted effort implies cultivating the opposite.

2.34: _vitarkā hiṃsādayaḥ kṛtakāritānumoditā lobhakrodhamohapūrvakā mṛdumadhyādhimātrā duḥkhājñānānantaphalā iti pratipakṣabhāvanam_  
The effort to harm, [lie, steal,] etc.—whether done [personally], caused to be done, or [simply] approved of; whether arising from greed, hatred, or delusion; whether subtle, medium, or extreme—has suffering and unending ignorance as its fruit. Therefore, their opposites should be cultivated.

2.35: _ahiṃsāpratiṣṭhāyāṃ tatsaṃnidhau vairatyāgaḥ_  
Being firmly grounded in non-harm, enmity is abandoned in that presence.

2.36: _satyapratiṣṭhāyāṃ kriyāphalāśrayatvam_  
Being firmly grounded in honesty ensures that actions are fruitful.

2.37: _asteyapratiṣṭhāyāṃ sarvaratnopasthānam_  
Being firmly grounded in non-stealing draws you close to all the [world's] treasures.

2.38: _brahmacaryapratiṣṭhāyāṃ vīryalābhaḥ_  
Being firmly grounded in chastity, vitality is obtained.

2.39: _aparigrahasthairye janmakathaṃtāsaṃbodhaḥ_  
Being settled on non-addiction awakens us to the process of rebirth.

2.40: _śaucāt svāṅgajugupsā parair asaṃsargaḥ_  
Through purity, the protection of your own limbs and the non-contamination of others.

2.41: _sattva-śuddhi-saumanasya-ikāgryendriya-jayātma-darśana-yogyatvāni ca_  
[The higher] purity of mind is [achieved through] gladness, one-pointedness, mastery of the faculties, and the ability to know one's self.

2.42: _saṃtoṣād anuttamaḥ sukhalābhaḥ_  
Contentment is the highest pleasure.

2.43: _kāyendriyasiddhir aśuddhikṣayāt tapasaḥ_  
Austerity is the wearing away of [mental] impurities through the power of the body’s faculties.

2.44: _svādhyāyād iṣṭadevatāsaṃprayogaḥ_  
Through recitation, contact with the chosen deity.

2.45: _samādhisiddhir īśvarapraṇidhānāt_  
Through devotion to the present, the attainment of *samādhi*.

2.46: _sthirasukham āsanam_  
A stable, comfortable posture

2.47: _prayatnaśaithilyānantasamāpattibhyām_  
by deliberate relaxation and nonstop unification

2.48: _tato dvandvānabhighātaḥ_  
From that, one is not bothered by dualities

2.49: _tasmin sati śvāsapraśvāsayor gativicchedaḥ prāṇāyāmaḥ_  
Mindful of inhalation and exhalation in this way, while cutting off [other] activities, is watching the breath.

2.50: _bāhyābhyantarastambhavṛttir deśakālasaṃkhyābhiḥ paridṛṣṭo dīrghasūkṣmaḥ_  
Externally or internally, with a fixed or moving point [of awareness], for a duration or for a count, watch long and short [breaths].

2.51: _bāhyābhyantaraviṣayākṣepī caturthaḥ_  
The fourth [*jhana*] transcends in and out.

2.52: _tataḥ kṣīyate prakāśāvaraṇam_  
There, the covering of the light [of the *citta*] disappears.

2.53: _dhāraṇāsu ca yogyatā manasaḥ_  
And it is there that the mind is [finally] fit for application.

2.54: _svaviṣayāsaṃprayoge cittasvarūpānukāra ivendriyāṇāṃ pratyāhāraḥ_  
Its things disunite [from it], just as appearances did from the faculties during sense restraint.

2.55: _tataḥ paramā vaśyatendriyāṇām_  
From this: full control of the faculties.



## Chapter 3: Breaking Through






3.1: _deśabandhaś cittasya dhāraṇā_  
Application is directing the *citta*.

3.2: _tatra pratyayaikatānatā dhyānam_  
Meditation is one-way-going attention.

3.3: _tad evārthamātranirbhāsaṃ svarūpaśūnyam iva samādhiḥ_  
*Samādhi* is when only that intention shines forth and all appearances are seen as empty.

3.4: _trayam ekatra saṃyamaḥ_  
The three [application, meditation, and *samādhi*] come together in revelation.

3.5: _tajjayāt prajñālokaḥ_  
That conquest: the shining forth of discernment.

3.6: _tasya bhūmiṣu viniyogaḥ_  
It proceeds by stages,

3.7: _trayam antaraṅgaṃ pūrvebhyaḥ_  
the three being the inner parts of the practice.

3.8: _tad api bahiraṅgaṃ nirbījasya_  
Yet they are (all three) external to the seedless.

3.9: _vyutthānanirodhasaṃskārayor abhibhavaprādurbhāvau nirodhakṣaṇacittānvayo nirodhapariṇāmaḥ_  
When exuberance ceases and [burdensome] mental activity lifts, manifesting stops and the pull of the divided heart too: this is [real] change.

3.10: _tasya praśāntavāhitā saṃskārāt_  
This calm flow is [conditioned] by [certain, prior] mental actions.

3.11: _sarvārthataikāgratayoḥ kṣayodayau cittasya samādhipariṇāmaḥ_  
The fading away of all objectives and the arising of one-pointedness is the change-of-heart called *samādhi*.

3.12: _tataḥ punaḥ śāntoditau tulyapratyayau cittasyaikāgratāpariṇāmaḥ_  
From there, higher tranquility with matching attention is the change-of-heart called [full] one-pointedness.

3.13: _etena bhūtendriyeṣu dharmalakṣaṇāvasthāpariṇāmā vyākhyātāḥ_  
This explains [why] the quality, character, and appearance of the [sense] objects and faculties change.

3.14: _śāntoditāvyapadeśyadharmānupātī dharmī_  
[Yet] the *dharma* of the three times conforms to the teachings.

3.15: _kramānyatvaṃ pariṇāmānyatve hetuḥ_  
Different sequences cause different changes.

3.16: _pariṇāmatrayasaṃyamād atītānāgatajñānam_  
Knowing the three changes reveals the past and future.

3.17: _śabdārthapratyayānām itaretarādhyāsāt saṃkaras tatpravibhāgasaṃyamāt sarvabhūtarutajñānam_  
Attending to words and confusing them with meaning is [delusional] mental activity. Discerning this difference reveals the nature of all the world's languages.

3.18: _saṃskārasākṣātkaraṇāt pūrvajātijñānam_  
Through the direct perception of the mind-stream, [the yogin can gain] knowledge of [their] past lives

3.19: _pratyayasya paracittajñānam_  
Through attention, the minds of others.

3.20: _na ca tat sālambanaṃ tasyāviṣayībhūtatvāt_  
Such [insights] are, however, conditioned because they are subjective.

3.21: _kāyarūpasaṃyamāt tadgrāhyaśaktistambhe cakṣuḥprakāśāsaṃprayoge 'ntardhānam_  
[Meditating on] the physical body reveals its disappearance through arresting the grasping faculty and through disconnecting the eye from light.

3.22: _sopakramaṃ nirupakramaṃ ca karma tatsaṃyamād aparāntajñānam ariṣṭebhyo vā_  
Knowing ripe and unripe karma—or [reading] the signs—reveals how things end.

3.23: _maitryādiṣu balāni_  
Loving-kindness, etc are [also] powers.

3.24: _baleṣu hastibalādīni_  
[And] from [psychic] power, physical power, etc.

3.25: _pravṛttyālokanyāsāt sūkṣmavyavahitaviprakṛṣṭajñānam_  
Focusing on the experience of light [reveals] knowledge of things subtle, hidden, and far away

3.26: _bhuvanajñānaṃ sūrye saṃyamāt_  
[Just as] the sun reveals the earth

3.27: _candre tārāvyūhajñānam_  
The moon, the arrangement of the stars

3.28: _dhruve tadgatijñānam_  
The north star, knowledge of their motion

3.29: _nābhicakre kāyavyūhajñānam_  
The navel wheel, knowledge of the arrangement of the body

3.30: _kaṇṭhakūpe kṣutpipāsānivṛttiḥ_  
The throat well, the [cause and] cessation of hunger and thirst

3.31: _kūrmanāḍyāṃ sthairyam_  
[Or] the way of the tortoise, [reveals] steadiness

3.32: _mūrdhajyotiṣi siddhadarśanam_  
[so too,] the light in the head reveals the divine eye

3.33: _prātibhād vā sarvam_  
Or, in a flash, everything.

3.34: _hṛdaye cittasaṃvit_  
In the heart, understanding of the *citta* [arises]

3.35: _sattvapuruṣayor atyantāsaṃkīrṇayoḥ pratyayāviśeṣo bhogaḥ parārthāt svārthasaṃyamāt puruṣajñānam_  
[Understanding] distinguishes between the meaning of “person” and the function of the mind which reveals knowledge of the person. Normal experience is attention which conflates one with the other.

3.36: _tataḥ prātibhaśrāvaṇavedanādarśāsvādavārtā jāyante_  
This produces flashes of hearing, feeling, seeing, tasting, [and] smelling.

3.37: _te samādhāv upasargā vyutthāne siddhayaḥ_  
Which are obstacles to *samādhi*, but are powers upon emerging.

3.38: _bandhakāraṇaśaithilyāt pracārasaṃvedanāc ca cittasya paraśarīrāveśaḥ_  
The mind enters a body when the causes binding it loosen and it is compelled that way.

3.39: _udānajayāj jalapaṅkakaṇṭakādiṣv asaṅga utkrāntiś ca_  
[But] vanquishing cries, [the conqueror] rises out of the mud and water, untouched by [such] thorns.

3.40: _samānajayāj jvalanam_  
Conquering existence, [the victor] shines.

3.41: _śrotrākāśayoḥ saṃbandhasaṃyamād divyaṃ śrotram_  
The relationship between ear and air reveals divine hearing.

3.42: _kāyākāśayoḥ saṃbandhasaṃyamāl laghutūlasamāpatteś cākāśagamanam_  
The relationship between the body and air, and how cotton attains its lightness, reveal [how] the body goes through the air.

3.43: _bahir akalpitā vṛttir mahāvidehā tataḥ prakāśāvaraṇakṣayaḥ_  
When the mind moves to the formless state, beyond the body, the covering of the light [of the citta] is weakened.

3.44: _sthūlasvarūpasūkṣmānvayārthavattvasaṃyamād bhūtajayaḥ_  
The grossness, appearance, subtlety, constitution, and purposefulness of objects reveal their conquest.

3.45: _tato 'ṇimādiprādurbhāvaḥ kāyasaṃpat taddharmānabhighātaś ca_  
From this come [the insights] such as the atomization of objects, etc, and the direct, pristine [knowledge] of the Dharma's indestructibility.

3.46: _rūpalāvaṇyabalavajrasaṃhananatvāni kāyasaṃpat_  
Graceful in form, strong and unbreakable like a diamond: this is a perfect body.

3.47: _grahaṇasvarūpāsmitānvayārthavattvasaṃyamād indriyajayaḥ_  
Conceit, grasping at appearances, and the tug of meaning reveal how to conquer the faculties.

3.48: _tato manojavitvaṃ vikaraṇabhāvaḥ pradhānajayaś ca_  
From this comes fleetness, independent of the senses: the conquest of mind over matter.

3.49: _sattvapuruṣānyatākhyātimātrasya sarvabhāvādhiṣṭhātṛtvaṃ sarvajñātṛtvaṃ ca_  
Even just once seeing this distinction between the mind and the person can lead to a supreme, omniscient existence.

3.50: _tadvairāgyād api doṣabījakṣaye kaivalyam_  
[But] through dispassion towards even this, [and] with the [prior] weakening of the seeds of delusion, [instead comes] liberation.

3.51: _sthānyupanimantraṇe saṅgasmayākaraṇaṃ punar aniṣṭaprasaṅgāt_  
Though able to attain a high rebirth [from that point, the yogin,] inclined to disinterest, gives rise [instead] to no more attachment or pride.

3.52: _kṣaṇatatkramayoḥ saṃyamād vivekajaṃ jñānam_  
Knowledge born of seclusion reveals the sequence of moments.

3.53: _jātilakṣaṇadeśair anyatānavacchedāt tulyayos tataḥ pratipattiḥ_  
From this, [the yogi] differentiates between similar things previously indistinguishable by origin, characteristic, or position.

3.54: _tārakaṃ sarvaviṣayaṃ sarvathāviṣayam akramaṃ ceti vivekajaṃ jñānam_  
[This] knowledge-born-of-seclusion of all objects everywhere and of all times is the liberator.

3.55: _sattvapuruṣayoḥ śuddhisāmye kaivalyam iti_  
Mind and self thus purified, [the meditator attains] liberation.



## Chapter 4: Liberation






4.1: _janmauṣadhimantratapaḥsamādhijāḥ siddhayaḥ_  
Altered states of consciousness can come from *samādhi*, austerities, prayer, herbs or naturally.

4.2: _jātyantarapariṇāmaḥ prakṛtyāpūrāt_  
Diversity and change are nature's bounty.

4.3: _nimittam aprayojakaṃ prakṛtīnāṃ varaṇabhedas tu tataḥ kṣetrikavat_  
Like a farmer, nature picks and chooses, but doesn't directly cause.

4.4: _nirmāṇacittāny asmitāmātrāt_  
Beings are created by conceit alone.

4.5: _pravṛttibhede prayojakaṃ cittam ekam anekeṣām_  
The one *citta* is diversified by its various activities.

4.6: _tatra dhyānajam anāśayam_  
Of these, only the meditation-born is fruitless.

4.7: _karmāśuklākṛṣṇaṃ yoginas trividham itareṣām_  
The karma of [such] a *yogi* is neither white nor black; [but] for others is threefold,

4.8: _tatas tadvipākānuguṇānām evābhivyaktir vāsanānām_  
the fruition of which corresponds to the tendency on display at that time.

4.9: _jātideśakālavyavahitānām apy ānantaryaṃ smṛtisaṃskārayor ekarūpatvāt_  
The uniformity between [subconscious] activity and memory ensures the correspondence [of cause and effect] despite distance in time, space, and rebirths

4.10: _tāsām anāditvaṃ cāśiṣo nityatvāt_  
which are without beginning, being based on never-ending desires.

4.11: _hetuphalāśrayālambanaiḥ saṃgṛhītatvād eṣām abhāve tadabhāvaḥ_  
Because of the connection between cause and effect, basis and support, [it follows that] if one goes, the other must too.

4.12: _atītānāgataṃ svarūpato 'sty adhvabhedād dharmāṇām_  
So, past and future do exist, in their own way.

4.13: _te vyaktasūkṣmā guṇātmānaḥ_  
Gross or subtle, [things] are [merely] composed of sense-impressions.

4.14: _pariṇāmaikatvād vastutattvam_  
The “that-ness” of an object is [merely the perception of] homogeneous change.

4.15: _vastusāmye cittabhedāt tayor vibhaktaḥ panthāḥ_  
Materialism and idealism are two, divergent paths [for describing reality].

4.16: _na caikacittatantraṃ vastu tadapramāṇakaṃ tadā kiṃ syāt_  
If an object were [merely] the construction of a single consciousness, how could it be measured? [If not objective,] what could it be?

4.17: _taduparāgāpekṣitvāc cittasya vastu jñātājñātam_  
[Yet,] an object can only be known if it excites the *citta*.

4.18: _sadā jñātāś cittavṛttayas tatprabhoḥ puruṣasyāpariṇāmitvāt_  
The [idea of an] unchanging “self” arises from continuously knowing this whirling *citta*.

4.19: _na tat svābhāsaṃ dṛśyatvāt_  
[But] it cannot see itself as an object.

4.20: _ekasamaye cobhayānavadhāraṇam_  
Never cognizing both [seer and seen] simultaneously,

4.21: _cittāntaradṛśye buddhibuddher atiprasaṅgaḥ smṛtisaṃkaraś ca_  
[the best it can do] is to see a previous mind moment by becoming aware of awareness's impact on memory and mental activity.

4.22: _citer apratisaṃkramāyās tadākārāpattau svabuddhisaṃvedanam_  
Unmoving awareness assumes the shape of the particular conscious experience.

4.23: _draṣṭṛdṛśyoparaktaṃ cittaṃ sarvārtham_  
Any object inflames the *citta* with the seer and the seen.

4.24: _tad asaṃkhyeyavāsanābhiś citram api parārthaṃ saṃhatyakāritvāt_  
Activity combines that object with others, along with the countless underlying tendencies.

4.25: _viśeṣadarśina ātmabhāvabhāvanānivṛttiḥ_  
[Directly] seeing this distinction between “being a Self” and “[the process of] becoming” is the counter-whirling.

4.26: _tadā vivekanimnaṃ kaivalyaprāgbhāraṃ cittam_  
The *citta* then inclines towards detachment and is therefore borne onwards towards liberation.

4.27: _tacchidreṣu pratyayāntarāṇi saṃskārebhyaḥ_  
Activity is a gap in our attention.

4.28: _hānam eṣāṃ kleśavad uktam_  
Calming [all activity] is as described for the *kilesas*.

4.29: _prasaṃkhyāne 'py akusīdasya sarvathā vivekakhyāter dharmameghaḥ samādhiḥ_  
Ever intent yet aloof through the second attainment of detachment, [the meditator eventually attains] the “Dharma Cloud” *samādhi*.

4.30: _tataḥ kleśakarmanivṛttiḥ_  
This is a break from the *kilesas* and from *karma*.

4.31: _tadā sarvāvaraṇamalāpetasya jñānasyānantyāj jñeyam alpam_  
When the imperfection covering “the all” is removed that which remains to be known is little.

4.32: _tataḥ kṛtārthānāṃ pariṇāmakramasamāptir guṇānām_  
Their purposes served, sense-contact and the sequences of change end.

4.33: _kṣaṇapratiyogī pariṇāmāparāntanirgrāhyaḥ kramaḥ_  
“A sequence” [because] an end to change is attainable.

4.34: _puruṣārthaśūnyānāṃ guṇānāṃ pratiprasavaḥ kaivalyaṃ svarūpapratiṣṭhā vā citiśaktir iti_  
Going against the stream of the senses, empty of purpose for a self, the liberation of appearances from being established is the ultimate power of awareness.
